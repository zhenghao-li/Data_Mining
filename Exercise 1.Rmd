# 1. Data Visualization: Flights at ABIA

## 1.1 How Does the Airport Traffic Looks Like
This set of plots looks at the ABIA airport traffic over the course of the year, days of week and time of the days. As expected, the airport seems to be the busiest in June and surprisingly  it has the least amount of flights in November if we consider the Thanksgiving holidays. As expected, the airport was busy in weekdays and had about 25% less flights on Saturday that on weekdays. If we look at the time of day, the airport has accepted the largest amount of flights around 17 p.m. with almost very rare flights after midnight, whereas the flights from Austin flew mostly around 19 p.m. and 13 p.m..

## 1.2 Which City Has the Most Flights from Austin?
<<<<<<< HEAD

The map shows the airports whose out of Austin flights have the highest departure delay on average. The darker points indicate higher mean of departure delay. Here, the darkest point on the map is the DSM airport with an average departure delay of more than 125 minutes. 
=======
This figure ranks the cities in the US for the flights that occured from Austin. Not surprisingly, the top three destinations for Austin originated flights were Texas cities which were twice as frequent than the majority of other cities.

<<<<<<< HEAD
To construct the map, we first grouped the ABIA data by destination and calculated the mean for each destination airport. Afterwards, we used the airports data from the MUCflights which includes the airport names abbreviation and the cities where they are located. The airports table has been joined with the “data” table which includes the mean of delayed departure by airports. The common column by which the joined has occurred is the airports name column: “Dest”.  

## 1.3 Are Monthly Average Departure Delay and Arrival Delay Different
=======
## 1.3 What is the best time of year to fly to minimize delays?
In this figure, we look at the mean of arrival and departure delays separately, to see which months have the highest average delays. In general, it is expected that departing flights have higher average delay time than arrivals. If we look at the months, December is a leading month for both the highest average arrival and departure delays, although we have found before that relatively it didn't have the highest number of flights, which might be explained with the weather conditions of this month. According to the data, the best time of the year to minimize both the departure and arrival delays is September, which has about 3 minutes average departure time and very surprisingly zero average arrival delay time.

## 1.4 For Every Weekday, Which Month Is the Worst For Travel
<<<<<<< HEAD
The graph displays the average of departure delays for each weekday of the month. For example, if the traveler is planning on traveling December on a Saturday, he can expect to encounter a departure delay of 18 minutes on average. However, if a traveler usually travels for business purposes, he or she would mostly travel on weekdays such as Mondays or Tuesdays, whose highest expected delays on average occur in March.

<<<<<<< HEAD
For this graph, the data – ABIA has been grouped first by Month and then by Day of Week by taking the average of DepDelay for each weekday of the month. In this way, we can account for the different delays that are expected for each weekday of the month, since delays tend to vary by month. There are months in which business travelers dominate such as March and April, hence the weekdays with high delays will on average be Monday to Thursday. On the other hand, leisure travelers tend to travel mostly in December, thus highest delays for this month will be expected during the weekend.

## 1.5 Which Month Has the Most Extreme Delays
=======
## 1.5 Which Month Has the Most Extreme Delays
If we look from the perspective of extreme departure delays which is higher than the 90th percentile - 33 minute of departure delays, December and July will lead in the length of the time of delays, whereas March and June have the highest 12 % probability of extreme delay. That could be explained by our previous finding that these monthes were leaders in the volume of air traffic in ABIA.

## 1.7 When and how long to expect the delays?
In the following two set of plots, we look at the specific time of the day and length of delay separately for arrivals and departures. The longest and the majority of the delays happened from 12:00 p.m. to 02:00 a.m., with less frequent departure delays after midnight, which aligns with our previous finding that there very rare departing flights at this time of the day.

##1.9 Which Month Has Most Cancellations

## 1.9 When to expect cancellations?
If we look at all the cancelled flights in ABIA, we will not be surprised to see March as a leading month in the number of cancelled flights followed by April. Particularly, about 2.5% of flights in March were cancelled.

At first, let us have a glimpse of the 350 trim level data and 63AMG trim level data. The figure 1 is the scatter plot of price and mileage of 350 trim level cars. In general, the data shows a negative relationship between price and mileage.  However, those points are separated into two parts: the part in the northwestern area and the part at the bottom spreading to the right side. It implies that a line regression may have misspecification for our data. The figure 2 is for the 65AMG trim level cars. It also shows a negative relationship between mileage and price.

## 2.2 The Optimal K Vlaue for 350 Trim Level
Our general procedure is as follows: first, splitting the data into Train subset and Test subset. Based on the estimates of K-nearest neighbors in Train subset, we get our predications on the Test subset, and then calculate the RMSE (out-of-sample root mean-squared error).

For 350 trim level, we started from K=3 (K=2 results in an error) to K=332 (the number of rows in the Train subset). The optimal K is the K corresponding to the smallest RMSE. Since for each time when we randomly select a Train subset, the optimal K varies. To be rigorous, we generated 50 Train subsets, and then got an optimal K for each Train subset. The first figure shows one of our optimal K and how we got it by RMSE. The second figure shows the plot of fitted model for this K. The third figure shows the spread of 50 optimal K’s and its mean (after taking integer). Then we gave the summary of those 50 optimal K values.

Comparing those two summaries of optimal K for 350 trim level and 65AMG trim level, the 350 trim level has higher mean, median, and variance. The main reason is probably that the data of 350 trim level is more spreading than the data of 65AMG trim level. So to fit the data, 350 trim level need near points more far away, which requires more nearest points to lower the RMSE as much as possible.
